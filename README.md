**Overview of the Code**

This Python script reads data from a CSV file, performs basic analysis, and generates a well-formatted PDF report using the FPDF library.

**Purpose**

The goal of the script is to:

Read and process tabular data from a file (e.g., a CSV).
Analyze the data to extract meaningful insights.
Create a professional PDF report that summarizes the analysis and presents the data in a readable format.

**Key Components**

**Data Analysis**
Library Used: pandas for efficient data handling and analysis.
Steps Performed:
Reads data from a CSV file.
Calculates:
Total sales.
Average sales.
Identifies the top seller (name and sales amount).

**PDF Generation**
Library Used: FPDF for creating and customizing the PDF document.
PDFReport Class:
Customizes the header, footer, and main body of the PDF.
Includes helper methods:
add_section_title: Adds section headings.
add_text: Writes plain text paragraphs.
add_table: Dynamically generates a table from the CSV data.

**Workflow**
Reads the CSV file (data.csv).
Analyzes the data and extracts summary metrics.

Generates a PDF with:
Overview Section: Contains summary metrics like total sales, average sales, and the top seller.
Table Section: Displays the raw data in a tabular format.

**Key Functions**
analyze_data(file_path)

Reads the CSV file.
Calculates total sales, average sales, and identifies the top seller.
Returns the data and analysis results.

PDFReport Class

A custom class inheriting from FPDF.

Defines:

header: Adds a title to the top of each page.
footer: Adds a page number at the bottom.
Helper methods for section titles, plain text, and tables.
generate_pdf_report(file_path, output_file)

Handles the overall process:

Overview Section: Summarizes key metrics like total sales and the top seller.
Table Section: Displays the original data in a neat table format.
File Name: sales_report.pdf

Console output confirms successful generation:
mathematica
Copy code
PDF report generated: sales_report.pdf

**Highlights**

Dynamic Table Creation:
Automatically adjusts to the data in the CSV file.

Customizable Design:
Headers, footers, and content can be tailored for different use cases.

Portable and Expandable:
Easily integrates with other data sources or visualization tools.
Possible Enhancements

Charts and Visualizations:
Use libraries like matplotlib to add graphs or charts to the PDF.

Enhanced Formatting:
Include styling options like colors, logos, or custom fonts.

Automate File Input/Output:
Allow dynamic file paths or process multiple CSV files at once.
